# DD Starter Template 

1. Navigate to your Wordpress local development environment and into your 'themes' directory 

2. Install the starter theme within this folder. You can clone the repository by using git clone.



3. First and very importantly delete the .git folder within the theme folder (this will be hidden). You are then free to initialise your own repository for your new site whenever you like.



4. Enter theme directory then initilise with this command in terminal


```npm init -y```



5. Then install dependencies with


```npm i```



6. This will install Parcel so you can run your own local development server - This will watch for any changes in the styling/js  and will rebuild the assets when changes are made to them. To start run:


```npm run start```



7. Activate your new theme within the wordpress dashboard and get editing!
